# Generator of Seasons images

This project was written for course of "Computer Graphics" which I've listened in MUCTR. Solomonova N.D had read these lectures. Under running the program draws images with a random scenery of some year time. The drawing algorithm uses the Golden Section and the Fibonacci number series.
