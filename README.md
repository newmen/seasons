# Generator of Seasons images

This project was wrote for course of "Computer Graphics" which I've listened in MUCTR. Lectures were read by Solomonova N.D. Under running the program graws images with random scenery of some year time. The drawing algorithm uses the Golden Section and the Fibonacci number series.

The program is writen in the ancient Turbo C++ 3.0.
